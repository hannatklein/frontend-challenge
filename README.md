# Frontend Challenge
Used HTML & CSS to build a responsive screen for the bus route view for the BusyBus app.

THE PROBLEM

Chicagoâ€™s bus routes are expanding and multiple have been added to the Washington & State stop. Before arriving at the bus stop, riders want to know when their respective buses are arriving and how long they have to get to the bus stop. 

THE SOLUTION

I designed a mobile app that displays the necessary information for the Washington & State bus stop, including which bus routes service the stop, when buses are arriving in chronological order, and how frequent each bus is. BusyBus is the intuitive solution that encompasses everything a rider needs, including bus schedules and live tracking.
